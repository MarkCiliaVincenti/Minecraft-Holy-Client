## Features

- **Custom proxies**. It is possible to load custom proxies from a link and a file.
- **Multiverse in bots**. Bots can enter servers from 1.12.2 to 1.19.3. Temporarily not all packets are supported, this is being actively worked on.
- **Using user behavior for stress testing**. 

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

## Custom plugin

The default plugin has few features. It just sends `/register <pass> <pass>`  first and starts spamming immediately. 
Minecraft servers are a large number, with different anti-bot systems and if you want to test your server for bot attacks, it makes sense to write a custom plugin that would bypass it. How to write custom plugins is written here.
