## App
  - Added support for simple multiversion spam bots. So far, they only know how to register (/reg \<pass\> \<confirm pass\>) and immediately spam in the chat. Will be improved in the future.

  - "Spam bots" renamed to "Smart bots" as support for new features will be added in the future and the phrase "Spam bots" will no longer be appropriate.

## DDOS
  - Fixed a potential memory leak when switching pages.
  - Now page switching works correctly and you can change the language during DDoS without bugs with the schedule.
